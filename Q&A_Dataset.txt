### Response: The theses focus on port and coastal scenarios. For open sea, additional testing and protections would be required for wind and high waves.

### Prompt: How much maintenance is needed between missions?
### Response: Not explicitly stated in the documents, but light maintenance is likely: battery checks, sensor cleaning, connectivity and actuator verification.

### Prompt: What happens if a sensor fails during a mission?
### Response: ROS2 includes diagnostic tools, but the theses don’t detail automatic fallback strategies. Generally, remote control takes over.

### Prompt: Can the boat decide by itself when to dock, or does it need a command?
### Response: The docking algorithms handle the maneuver, but it’s unclear whether the boat initiates docking autonomously. Human intervention is likely.

### Prompt: Is it suitable for environmental missions like water quality or wildlife monitoring?
### Response: The theses don’t cover this, but the platform is flexible enough to accommodate environmental sensors. Specific adaptations would be required.

### Prompt: What’s the typical use case for this boat?
### Response: It’s used for autonomous docking research, marine robotics testing, and algorithm development in academic settings.

### Prompt: How is the boat protected from theft or tampering?
### Response: The VPN and firewall restrict access to the control systems. Physical locks can secure components, and GPS tracking is possible.

### Prompt: What if it flips over?
### Response: The catamaran design gives excellent stability, but it is not self-righting. Capsize recovery would require manual retrieval.

### Prompt: Is it legal to use in public waterways?
### Response: Local regulations apply, in Norway, experimental ASVs must be registered and follow maritime safety rules.

### Prompt: Can the boat detect marine life?
### Response: Not by default, but with added sonar or vision-based detection models, it could be adapted for environmental missions.

### Prompt: Can the boat run preloaded missions without internet access?
### Response: Yes, it can execute preloaded routes entirely offline using onboard storage and ROS2 launch configurations.

### Prompt: What happens in case of power failure?
### Response: The onboard computer will safely shut down: mission logs are preserved, and external alerts can be sent before total shutdown if power monitoring is active.

### Prompt: Can the vessel record data during missions?
### Response: Yes, it records synchronized LiDAR, IMU, GNSS, and camera data using MCAP and SVO2 formats for later analysis.

###Prompt: How is the boat protected from theft or tampering?
###Response: The VPN and firewall restrict access to the control systems. Physical locks can secure components, and GPS tracking is possible.
###Prompt: What if it flips over?
###Response: The catamaran design gives excellent stability, but it is not self-righting. Capsize recovery would require manual retrieval.
###Prompt: Is it legal to use in public waterways?
###Response: Local regulations apply; in Norway, experimental ASVs must be registered and follow maritime safety rules.
###Prompt: Can the boat detect marine life?
###Response: Not by default, but with added sonar or vision-based detection models, it could be adapted for environmental missions.
